    <p class="body">We had to consider what kind of game we would like to make which also fulfilled the theme of 'You Are Your Own Enemy'.</p>
    <p class="body">We decided to create a game in which a shadow of yourself posesses you at various points through the game.</p>
    <p class="body">Your goal is to deliver the cure to a zombie virus that is ravaging the world to the Pentagon.</p>
    <p class="body">However, while you want to travel peacefully, as you know that the zombies that oppose you can be cured, </p>
    <p class="body">your alter ego forces you to do whatever it takes to achieve your goal as fast as possible.</p>
    <p class="body">We feel like this is a very unique game idea that was highly influenced by our team members' personal tastes.</p>

    <br>
    

    <p class="body">This game is being developed in Godot 4.3, music is being created in GarageBand, and art is being done in Procreate.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p class="body">Godot is a great open source engine that is amazing for 2D games. We have some experience with it in the past,</p>
    <p class="body">hence why we chose it for this project. We usually think about what needs to happen in pseudocode and then implement it.</p>

    <p class="body">I chose to use Garage   band because of how intuitive and beginner friendly it is. When making music, I consider the theme of the project, </p>
    <p class="body">and you have lots of free tools to work with. You can also import more from the Internet.</p>
    <p class="body">but I mainly focus on what appeals to me. I feel that as a musician, making music is how I can express myself,</p>
    <p class="body">which is how and why I make my music.</p>

    <p class="body">I like using Procreate because it's incredibly convenient. You're able to access all of its features with minimal effort or confusion, </p>
    <p class="body">and you have lots of free tools to work with. You can also import more from the Internet.</p>
    <p class="body">I've always liked art ever since I was a little kid. Art is the way I can put my ideas into the world and immortalize them.</p>
